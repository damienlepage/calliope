# G1: Verify live feedback panel meets PRD metrics + copy

Audit FeedbackPanel and CompactFeedbackOverlay against PRD requirements; adjust labels/units if needed and add regression tests for any changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

Feedback panel shows pace (with WPM), crutch word count, pause count with avg duration + rate, input level, and elapsed time while recording; idle state remains minimal; tests cover any updated formatting or state logic.
