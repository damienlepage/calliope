# G47: Recordings accessibility and VoiceOver audit

Ensure recordings list, detail sheet, and actions are fully navigable with VoiceOver and do not rely on color-only signals.

## Acceptance Criteria

Recordings table columns and action buttons have clear accessibility labels; integrity/status indicators include text for non-color cue; detail sheet controls are reachable and labeled for VoiceOver.
