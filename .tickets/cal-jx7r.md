# Recordings list concise naming format

Ensure the recordings list uses a concise, consistent display-name format for sessions and segments (G66).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recordings display names use a concise date/time format (no verbose prefix) with optional title appended.\n- Segmented sessions append a concise part label without duplicating date/title.\n- Recordings list still renders in table view with names readable without horizontal scrolling.
