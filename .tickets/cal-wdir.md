# G2: Audit privacy/permissions UX vs PRD

Verify privacy/permissions UX guardrails match PRD and update goals/status notes if aligned.

## Acceptance Criteria

1) Session screen remains minimal with no permission recovery actions. 2) Settings hosts disclosure and permission recovery actions. 3) Update goals.yaml/status.yaml notes to reflect verification or list gaps.
