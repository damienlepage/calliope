# G2: Audit privacy/permissions UX guardrails

Review Session and Settings screens to ensure permissions actions live only in Settings, disclosure text is present, and blocking reasons remain informational. Add/adjust tests if gaps found.

## Acceptance Criteria

Session screen shows only session-relevant UI; no permission action buttons outside Settings; Settings includes disclosure copy + mic status; tests cover any updates.
