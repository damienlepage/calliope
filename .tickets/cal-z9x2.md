# G66: Recordings list naming clarity

Make recordings list entries visible with a concise, readable naming format that surfaces the title/date without truncating the list.

## Acceptance Criteria

Recordings list primary column uses a concise name format (title or default date/time) that fits within the visible column width without forcing horizontal scrolling.
Name format stays consistent across list rows and detail views.
