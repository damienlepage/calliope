# Surface post-session summary stats in title prompt

Provide immediate access to key stats without navigating away from the session screen.

## Acceptance Criteria

- After stopping a session, the title prompt includes a compact summary of key stats (pace, crutch words, pauses, speaking time).\n- Summary pulls from saved analysis data for the completed session and handles missing summaries with friendly fallback text.\n- Summary remains viewable while the title prompt is shown.
