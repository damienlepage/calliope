# G39: Add live speaking time to feedback

Show speaking time in the real-time feedback panel (and compact overlay) during recording.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Live feedback shows speaking time alongside pace, crutch words, pauses, input level, and total time.
- Speaking time updates during recording and resets when a session stops.
- Tests cover speaking time update flow.
