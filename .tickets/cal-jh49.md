# Recordings header shows most recent timestamp

Expose the most recent recording timestamp in the recordings header to help users confirm new sessions are saved.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recordings header shows a 'Most recent' (or similar) timestamp when recordings are present.\n- No timestamp is shown when there are zero recordings.\n- Unit tests cover the formatting logic and empty state.
