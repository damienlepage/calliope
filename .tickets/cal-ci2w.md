# G61: Streamline live feedback layout order

Ensure the live feedback surface shows each required element exactly once in the PRD order: input level, WPM + target zone, elapsed time, speaking time, pauses, crutch words, live captions, coaching profile. Remove any duplicates or off-order placements in the session feedback panel (and keep layout calm/glanceable).

## Acceptance Criteria

Live feedback shows each required element exactly once in the specified order.\nNo duplicate metrics or off-order placements remain in the session feedback panel.\nLayout remains no-scroll at default window size.
