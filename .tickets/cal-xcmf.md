# G47: VoiceOver labels for live metrics and controls

Audit Session, Recordings, and Settings views for missing accessibility labels/values; add VoiceOver-friendly labels for live metrics and primary controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

Session live metrics expose clear accessibility labels and values (elapsed time, speaking time, pace, crutch count, pauses/min, input level). Primary controls (Start/Stop, CC toggle, profile picker, overlay toggle) have descriptive labels and hints. Recordings list actions (Open, Details, Delete, Open Folder) have labels and identifiers. Settings toggles and pickers have labels that match user-facing copy.
