# Define supported macOS versions for release verification

Document supported macOS versions (based on deployment target) and make release verification tables reflect the supported version set.

## Acceptance Criteria

README or release docs list supported macOS versions explicitly. Release QA template and/or checklist includes the supported versions in the packaged app verification table (pre-filled rows or guidance).
