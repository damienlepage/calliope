# Coaching profile management UI

Add a Settings flow to create, edit, and delete named coaching profiles with pace/pause/crutch preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

Settings shows a Coaching Profiles section with list + Manage action.\nManage sheet lets users add a new profile (name required), edit name and preferences, and delete a profile with confirmation.\nEdits persist via CoachingProfileStore and selection falls back to a valid profile after deletion.
