# Accessibility: Session & Live Feedback

Audit and update live session surfaces to meet PRD accessibility requirements (Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, no color-only cues).

## Acceptance Criteria

- SessionView, FeedbackPanel, CompactFeedbackOverlay, and InputLevelMeterView expose VoiceOver labels/values for all live metrics and controls\n- Pace/crutch/alert states include text equivalents so meaning is not color-only\n- Live captions toggle/contents and start/stop control have clear accessibility labels and hints
