# G66: Session screen cleanup and captions always visible

Ensure the Session surface stays fixed, calm, and fully visible when idle or recording.

## Acceptance Criteria

Start/Stop control remains pinned at the top of the Session screen with no scrolling at default size.\nFeedback panel stays visible even when idle and appears greyed/desaturated while inactive.\nRemove idle/status/capture/top-of-screen messaging and any session status popups or banners from the Session surface.\nLive captions remain visible at all times and show a placeholder when idle.
