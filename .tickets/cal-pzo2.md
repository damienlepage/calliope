# G45: Align recording details sheet with macOS conventions

Ensure the recording details sheet uses standard macOS sheet conventions with a clear Close action.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recording details sheet shows a clear Close button in the standard sheet action area (toolbar or bottom-right).
- Sheet layout follows macOS conventions (title in header/toolbar; no awkward stacked action rows).
- Close action dismisses the sheet.
