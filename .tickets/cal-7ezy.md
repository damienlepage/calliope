# G1: Confirm live feedback UX meets PRD

Review live feedback UI and data outputs against PRD requirements for pace, crutch words, pauses, input level, and session duration. Update goal status and notes if requirements are satisfied.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Validate Session screen shows live feedback panel only during recording and matches PRD items (pace, crutch words, pauses, input level, elapsed time).\n- Confirm pause metrics include frequency and duration info in UI.\n- Update goals.yaml to AT_TARGET for G1 with notes capturing validation date if criteria met.\n- Update status.yaml summary/last_reviewed if goal status changes.
