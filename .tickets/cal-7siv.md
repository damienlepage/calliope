# G50: Export diagnostics from Recordings view

Expose a privacy-safe diagnostics export action in the Recordings view without adding Settings clutter.

## Acceptance Criteria

Recordings view includes an 'Export Diagnostics' action. It writes a diagnostics JSON report using current app/permission/preference state and reveals the file in Finder. Unit coverage added or updated for report creation/export behavior.
