# Accessibility: Dynamic type + contrast pass for recordings/settings

Audit Recordings and Settings surfaces for Dynamic Type resilience, contrast, and non-color status cues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recordings list headers, status badges, and action controls remain readable at larger Dynamic Type sizes without truncating essential info.\n- Status indicators include text or symbol cues in addition to color; warnings remain clear in high contrast.\n- Settings controls (steppers, toggles, pickers, text fields) provide accessible labels/values and remain usable at larger text sizes.\n- Add/adjust automated coverage for any new formatting/helper logic introduced.
