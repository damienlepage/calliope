# Session screen layout: fixed, no scroll, start/stop always visible

Ensure the session screen keeps all elements visible without scrolling and pins start/stop at the top.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Start/Stop control remains visible at the top of the session screen at default window size.
- Session screen does not require scrolling at default window size.
- All live-session elements remain visible before START and after STOP, rendered in a greyed/inactive state when not recording.
