# G47: Settings accessibility labels and Dynamic Type verification

Audit Settings window for accessibility labels, grouping, and Dynamic Type support; ensure disclosures and controls read clearly via VoiceOver.

## Acceptance Criteria

Settings sections and controls expose concise accessibility labels/hints; privacy disclosures and guidance are readable with Dynamic Type; no information is conveyed solely via color in Settings.
