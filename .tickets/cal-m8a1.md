# Privacy verification in live conferencing calls

Validate that Calliope only detects the local speaker in real Zoom/Meet/Teams calls using both headset and speaker scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Run live call checks in Zoom, Google Meet (Chrome), and Microsoft Teams\n- Verify Calliope stays idle while other participants speak and that call audio is unaffected\n- Document results and any caveats in the latest release QA report or compatibility log
