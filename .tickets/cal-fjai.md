# Add post-session quick access to recordings

Add a lightweight post-session action so users can review stats/recordings immediately after stopping.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When a session stops and the title prompt is shown, a non-blocking action is visible to jump to the Recordings view.\n- Triggering the action switches the main navigation to Recordings without dismissing the pending title prompt.\n- The session title prompt remains available when returning to Session.
