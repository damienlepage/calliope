# Session accessibility compliance

Audit Session surface (including CC toggle, live metrics, overlay) for VoiceOver labels/values/hints, Dynamic Type scaling, and non-color status cues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Session controls and live metrics expose readable VoiceOver labels/values/hints (including pace, crutch words, pauses, speaking time, input level, captions, CC toggle, and recording start/stop).
- Status/warning states are communicated by text or icons, not color alone.
- Text remains readable at larger Dynamic Type sizes without truncating critical labels.
