# G66: Concise recordings list naming

Ensure recording names are concise and readable in the recordings list.

## Acceptance Criteria

Recordings list names avoid duplicating verbose default session titles and use concise date/time formatting by default.\nDisplay names remain stable across sessions and include part labels when applicable.\nUnit tests cover the concise naming behavior.
