Expose coaching profile selection on the Session screen (and/or Settings) with an override applied while recording.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Session UI shows current profile and lets the user pick another named profile.\n- Active analysis preferences use the selected profile while recording.\n- Selection persists per session start and is saved to recording metadata.
