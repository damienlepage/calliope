# G47: Session VoiceOver and accessibility labels

Audit Session + overlay surfaces for VoiceOver and non-color cues; ensure live metrics and controls expose labels, values, and hints.

## Acceptance Criteria

Session view exposes accessibility labels/values for live metrics (elapsed, speaking time, pace, crutch words, pauses/min, input level) and core controls (Start/Stop, CC toggle, profile picker) with VoiceOver-friendly ordering. Status/warning messaging conveys meaning without relying on color alone.
