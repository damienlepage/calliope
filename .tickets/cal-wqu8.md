# G23: Surface speaking activity in recordings UI

Expose speaking time and speaking turn counts in recordings list metadata and the recording detail sheet so users can browse how often they spoke and for how long.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recordings list items show speaking time and speaking turns alongside existing metadata when available.\n- Recording detail view includes a small section for speaking activity (total speaking time, speaking turns, speaking % of session).\n- Formatting handles long sessions (hours) and gracefully hides when metrics are unavailable.
