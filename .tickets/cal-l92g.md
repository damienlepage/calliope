# G57: Add VM-based packaged app verification guidance

Add virtualization-friendly QA guidance so packaged app verification can proceed without dedicated hardware.

## Acceptance Criteria

Release QA template and checklist capture whether verification ran on physical hardware vs VM and any virtualization caveats; QA handoff doc includes VM setup notes and additional mic validation step.
