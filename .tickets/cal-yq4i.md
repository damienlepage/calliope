# Prototype calmer feedback visuals

Polish feedback visuals to be more intuitive while staying lightweight.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Feedback panel introduces at least one visual cue (e.g., progress bar or badge) for pace and pauses that reduces scanning time.\n- Visual treatment remains calm and minimal, avoiding distracting animations.\n- Existing metrics remain accessible via text.
