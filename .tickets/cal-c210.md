# G58: Live feedback layout is clean and glanceable

Ensure the session feedback layout remains calm, fixed, and readable without scrolling at default window sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

Session feedback layout fits without scrolling at default window size during recording.\nFeedback panel keeps primary metrics visually grouped and aligned; captions and coaching profile do not cause layout overflow.\nAny layout adjustments include SwiftUI previews or unit coverage where feasible.
