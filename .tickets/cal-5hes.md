# Align compact overlay styling with calm feedback polish

Update CompactFeedbackOverlay styling to match the calmer feedback visual language introduced in the main panel.

## Acceptance Criteria

CompactFeedbackOverlay uses the same visual grouping and typography hierarchy as FeedbackPanel (aligned labels, spacing, and color emphasis).\nWarnings and capture status remain visible but de-emphasized relative to key metrics.\nNo metrics are removed, and overlay remains compact.
