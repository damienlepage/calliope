# G31: Add crutch-word preset descriptions

Add short descriptions for each preset and surface them in the UI to clarify intent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each crutch-word preset has a short description (1 sentence).
- Settings, coaching profiles, and per-app profiles surface the description alongside preset selection.
- Unit tests verify each preset has a non-empty description.
