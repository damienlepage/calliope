# Surface local recordings directory in UI

Make the local storage location visible to users so they know recordings stay on-device.

## Acceptance Criteria
- RecordingManager exposes the recordings directory URL for display.
- ContentView shows the local recordings directory path in the privacy/disclosure section.
- Tests cover the new recordings directory accessor.
