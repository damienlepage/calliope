# Review feedback panel layout against PRD

Validate live feedback panel contents and spacing against PRD expectations for pace, crutch words, pauses, input level, elapsed time.

## Acceptance Criteria

Feedback panel includes pace, crutch words, pauses, input level, and elapsed time with clear labels; idle view unaffected.

## Notes

**2026-02-06T08:25:30Z**

Added explicit "Elapsed" label next to the session duration text in the feedback panel header to make the time label clear without changing idle behavior.
