# G25: Surface performance validation checklist in Settings

Add the core performance validation checklist to Settings to make low-latency/energy guardrails actionable for releases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Settings > Performance & Energy shows a concise checklist covering idle baseline, steady-state recording, stress burst, memory drift, and Instruments capture.\n- Checklist includes target CPU/energy/memory/latency ranges (shortened) consistent with PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md.\n- Unit coverage added for the checklist data (non-empty sections/items).
