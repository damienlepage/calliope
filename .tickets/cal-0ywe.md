# Recordings and Settings accessibility compliance

Audit Recordings and Settings views for VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type scaling, and non-color cues on status indicators and controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Recordings list, detail sheet, and actions expose VoiceOver labels/values/hints for table columns, buttons, and metadata.
- Settings sections and controls are fully labeled for VoiceOver and remain legible at larger Dynamic Type sizes.
- Any status indicators include text or iconography so meaning is not color-only.
