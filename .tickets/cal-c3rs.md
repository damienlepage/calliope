# G26: Add conferencing compatibility verification log template

Provide a lightweight log template to capture compatibility test runs for Zoom/Meet/Teams.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Add a markdown template (or section in README) to record date, macOS version, app version, device, and outcomes for Zoom/Meet/Teams checks.\n- Note that tests should confirm Calliope only tracks the local speaker and does not alter call audio.
