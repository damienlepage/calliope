# Accessibility audit for Session/Recordings/Settings

Audit and improve VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and contrast handling across Session, Recordings, and Settings surfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

VoiceOver labels exist for live metrics, controls, and tables. Dynamic Type scaling respected with no clipping at default window sizes. Color-only messaging avoided for status/warnings. Added/updated tests for accessibility labels where feasible.
