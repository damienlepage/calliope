lessons:
  - "swift build failed due to toolchain/SDK mismatch and cache permission errors; may require matching toolchain or writable cache path."
  - "swift test hit the same SDK/toolchain mismatch and cache permission errors (ModuleCache under ~/.cache/clang)."
  - "swift build still fails when SwiftPM cache paths under ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm are not writable and the SDK/toolchain versions are mismatched."
